# üìÉDescription

The .ipynb file contains a code that reads and processes the .xlsx file using the "openpyx1" and "pandas" Python libs. The goal is to calculate the final rent value of each immobile (code) in the .xlsx file.

# üñ•Ô∏èHow To Run The Program?

To run and check my code, you will need to...

I. Open the work folder (in your File Explorer) which you want to save this repository's files (.xlsx and .ipynb).

II. Open the command prompt in the selected work folder.

III. Clone this repository into the selected work folder by typing:
 
[![git clone git@github.com:RachelS2/Calculadora_limpeza.git](https://img.shields.io/badge/-git%20clone%20git@github.com:RachelS2/Calculadora__limpeza.git-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/RachelS2/Calculadora_limpeza.git)

IV. Open the .ipynb file and run it (be sure you have all libs available to do so)

# üí°Program's Logic

To calculate the final rent, the following features (from each immobile) are considered and manipulated in the program:

- Number of guests 
- Number of rooms
- Amenities provided by the host
- Cleaning material
- Laundry items

# üì§Final Output

The program's final output is a .xlsx file (named "Resultado - Taxa de Limpeza") that basically copies the original one (named "Parametros - Taxa de Limpeza") but alters its first sheet by inserting each immobile rent value.
